## Codewars

Welcome to my Codewars repository! This repository contains my solutions to various CodeWars coding challenges. 
I will be adding solutions to CodeWars challenges as I complete more - I aim to solve at least one a day to pratice my coding skills and add notes explaining what I have learnt from that particular challenge.

## Difficulty Levels

For those who are unfamiliar with CodeWars, the difficulty level of each challenge is indicated by its "Kyu" 🥋 rating. The Kyu ratings range from 8 Kyu to 1 Kyu, with 8 Kyu being the easiest and 1 Kyu being the most difficult. The Kyu ratings are based on the following criteria:

In CodeWars, the Kyu ratings are inverted, meaning that a lower number indicates a higher difficulty level. Here's a brief explanation of the Kyu ratings:

👶- 8 Kyu: Beginner level challenges, suitable for those who are new to programming.

👦- 7 Kyu: Slightly more challenging problems, requiring some programming knowledge and skills.

🏃- 6 Kyu: Intermediate level challenges, involving more complex logic and problem-solving techniques.

💪- 5 Kyu: Advanced level challenges, suitable for experienced programmers.

😓- 4 Kyu: Hard challenges that often require advanced algorithms and data structures.

😱- 3 Kyu: Very hard challenges, requiring a deep understanding of programming concepts.

😡- 2 Kyu: Extremely difficult challenges, suitable for advanced programmers and algorithm experts.

👿- 1 Kyu: The most difficult challenges on CodeWars, often involving highly complex algorithms and problem-solving skills.
