## Codewars

Welcome to my Codewars repository! 

I will be adding solutions to Codewars challenges as I complete more - I aim to solve at least one a day as part of my daily practice to improve my coding skills. I will often add notes explaining what I have learnt from that particular challenge and compare to alternate solutions to learn new tips and tricks.

## Difficulty Levels

For those who are unfamiliar with CodeWars, the difficulty level of each challenge is indicated by its "kyu" 🥋 rating. The Kyu ratings range from 8 kyu to 1 kyu, with 8 kyu being the easiest and 1 kyu being the most difficult. The kyu ratings are based on the following criteria:

In Codewars, the Kyu ratings are inverted, meaning that a lower number indicates a higher difficulty level. Here's a brief explanation of the kyu ratings:

👶 - 8 kyu: Beginner level challenges, suitable for those who are new to programming.

👦 - 7 kyu: Slightly more challenging problems, requiring some programming knowledge and skills.

🏃 - 6 kyu: Intermediate level challenges, involving more complex logic and problem-solving techniques.

💪 - 5 kyu: Advanced level challenges, suitable for experienced programmers.

😓 - 4 kyu: Hard challenges that often require advanced algorithms and data structures.

😱 - 3 kyu: Very hard challenges, requiring a deep understanding of programming concepts.

😡 - 2 kyu: Extremely difficult challenges, suitable for advanced programmers and algorithm experts.

👿 - 1 kyu: The most difficult challenges on Codewars, often involving highly complex algorithms and problem-solving skills.
