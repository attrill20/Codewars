## Codewars

Welcome to my Codewars repository! 

I will be adding solutions to Codewars challenges as I complete more - I aim to solve at least one a day as part of my daily practice to improve my coding skills. I will often add notes explaining what I have learnt from that particular challenge and compare to alternate solutions to learn new tips and tricks.

## Difficulty Levels

For those who are unfamiliar with CodeWars, the difficulty level of each challenge is indicated by its "kyu" 🥋 rating. The Kyu ratings range from 8kyu to 1kyu, with 8kyu being the easiest and 1kyu being the most difficult. The kyu ratings are based on the following criteria:

In Codewars, the Kyu ratings are inverted, meaning that a lower number indicates a higher difficulty level. Here's a brief explanation of the kyu ratings:

👶- 8kyu: Beginner level challenges, suitable for those who are new to programming.

👦- 7kyu: Slightly more challenging problems, requiring some programming knowledge and skills.

🏃- 6kyu: Intermediate level challenges, involving more complex logic and problem-solving techniques.

💪- 5kyu: Advanced level challenges, suitable for experienced programmers.

😓- 4kyu: Hard challenges that often require advanced algorithms and data structures.

😱- 3kyu: Very hard challenges, requiring a deep understanding of programming concepts.

😡- 2kyu: Extremely difficult challenges, suitable for advanced programmers and algorithm experts.

👿- 1kyu: The most difficult challenges on Codewars, often involving highly complex algorithms and problem-solving skills.
